Programmer is windows only. Sorry folks. Although the concept is simple enough if you read the post on my blog above,
and use the same arduino backend. It is then just a matter of applying the calculation algorithm and pasrsing the encoded
data over a serial connection to the Arduino unit.

Simple. So please, if anyone is interested in doing a port I will gladly assist with the code.
